# React & Laravel - CyberHawk Assessment

This is a simple application built to fulfil the brief outlined below.

## Brief

> A wind turbine has 100 items on it, each gets inspected. Write an application that outputs numbers > from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print “Coating Damage” instead of the number and for the > multiples of five print “Lightning Strike” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples 
> of both three and five print “Coating Damage and Lightning Strike” instead of the number.
